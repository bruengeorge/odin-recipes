    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h4>Sedimentary rock is to Geology what Lasagna is to Pasta</h4>
    <p>Frankly just not a big fan of it, to be honest. It's grown on me over the years but I did not enjoy pasta in the slightest as a child.</p>
    <p>If there's enough meat, cheese, and whatever else you put in lasagna that isn't pasta - well then maybe we can get somewhere</p>
    <p>Too often, restaurants are stingy with their meat portions because it's more expensive to put more meat in</p>
    <p>This <em>ruins </em><strong>EVERYTHING</strong></p>
    <p>The ratio of pasta to meat in lasagna must grow to be far higher than the current 'norm' else I will rarely be able to enjoy the dish</p>
